# This script takes a markdown file with code blocks and
# creates separate files for each code block.

# The script also takes the first section of the markdown file
# and creates a README.md file in the output directory.

# The script assumes that the first code block is the README.md
# file and that the README.md file is the first section of the
# markdown file.

# The script assumes that the code blocks are in the format:
# ```<language>
# ```
# <code>
# ```
# ```
# <language> is the language of the code block, and <code> is
# the code itself.

# The script assumes that the markdown file is in the format:
# <README.md>
# <code block>
